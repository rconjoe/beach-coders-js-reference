# Arrays and Objects practice

Building on the primitive methods and some of the loops we learned so far:

[MDN - Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)

[MDN - Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

### Notes on the "flow"
We're trying to find the solutions to the problem here, but pay special attention to how we read through docs and solve problems by following a trail. 


Some of the concepts required to solve the problems in `objects.js` will require some reading on your part - like the `this` keyword ([documentation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this): make sure to try the examples).
